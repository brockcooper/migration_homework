# Migration Homework

To perform the migration of the old schema to the new schema, I would likely run raw SQL in the database, which I have created in the migration_homework.sql file.

To run this SQL file in Python, I also include a class I created in the run_postgres.py file, which will connect to a Postgres database and can run a selected SQL file.
